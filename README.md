# Better Sleep

This app is project 4 of "100 days of SwiftUI". The app lets you input the what time you want to wake up at tomorrow, how many of hours of sleep you want and the cups of coffee you drank today. The app then runs an ML model and predicts the right time you should go to bed, to get the requried amount of sleep and to wake up at your chosen hour.
